# Frontend–Backend API Contract

This document explains how the frontend and backend should work together.

---

## Overview

- **Backend’s job**: Collect job listings, run verification, and expose them through API endpoints.  
- **Frontend’s job**: Call those endpoints, show the results, and let users search/filter jobs.  

The frontend does not do verification. It only shows what backend provides.

---

## API Endpoints Needed

### 1. Get all jobs


**Response (JSON array):**
```json
[
  {
    "id": "uuid",
    "title": "Frontend Developer",
    "company": "Orbit Labs",
    "location": "San Diego, CA",
    "type": "Full Time",
    "salary": "$95k–$120k",
    "posted_at": "2025-10-18T12:05:00Z",
    "verdict": "Certified"
  }
]

2. Search/filter jobs
GET /api/jobs?q=react&location=remote&certified=true&sort=recent

Query params:

q → keyword (title, company, etc.)

location → filter by city or “remote”

certified → true/false

sort → “recent” or “score”

Frontend Notes

Until backend is ready, frontend uses demo jobs (hardcoded).

Later, frontend just replaces demo with real fetch:

fetch("http://localhost:5000/api/jobs")
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(setJobs);

  Backend Notes

Must expose /api/jobs.

Must return JSON in the structure shown above.

Handles all verification, scraping, or posting logic.


Workflow

Backend collects/verifies job data.

Backend exposes jobs via /api/jobs.

Frontend fetches jobs and displays them with filters/search.
